                    <h2>All about Jacob Hafner</h2>
                    <p> I love everything computers have to offer; I have been big into computers for most of my life.
                         I started gaming and using computers since I was a kid. Software Development has been a big interest of mine for some time,
                         I love back end coding as it is like a puzzle you have to try and solve. 
                         Through this semester I have learned a lot on HTML, CSS, and C#. I plan to continue to learn more languages throughout my remaining time at school.</p>
